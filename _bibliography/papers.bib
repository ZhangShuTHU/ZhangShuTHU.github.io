   abstract = {China's energy system requires a thorough transformation to achieve carbon neutrality. Here, leveraging the highly acclaimed The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System model of China (China TIMES) that takes energy, the environment, and the economy into consideration, four carbon-neutral scenarios are proposed and compared for different emission peak times and carbon emissions in 2050. The results show that China’s carbon emissions will peak at 10.3–10.4 Gt between 2025 and 2030. In 2050, renewables will account for 60% of total energy consumption (calorific value calculation) and 90% of total electricity generation, and the electrification rate will be close to 60%. The energy transition will bring sustained air quality improvement, with an 85% reduction in local air pollutants in 2050 compared with 2020 levels, and an early emission peak will yield more near-term benefits. Early peak attainment requires the extensive deployment of renewables over the next decade and an accelerated phasing out of coal after 2025. However, it will bring benefits such as obtaining better air quality sooner, reducing cumulative CO2 emissions, and buying more time for other sectors to transition. The pressure for more ambitious emission reductions in 2050 can be transmitted to the near future, affecting renewable energy development, energy service demand, and welfare losses.},

   abstract = {Summary China's carbon-neutral vision necessitates carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), which is still in its infancy due to inadequate infrastructure and indeterminate technology diffusion. To address the concerns, this study links spatially explicit CO2 source-sink matching with bottom-up energy-environment-economy planning to propose China's multi-sector-shared CCUS networks, with plant-level industrial transfer and infrastructure reuse considered. Nearly 19000-km trunk lines are needed by a capture of 1.74 Gt/yr in 2050, with 12-, 16-, 20-, and 24-inch pipelines enjoying the largest share of over 65%. Inspiringly, some CO2 routes accounting for 50% of the total length match well with the rights-of-way for oil and gas pipeline corridors. Regional cost-competitiveness improvement is observed given available offshore storage, with 0.2 Gt/yr redirected to the northern South China Sea. Furthermore, the interprovincial heterogeneity and intersectoral externality of CCUS scaling-up are unveiled, requiring a rational allocation of benefits and costs inherent in the value chains.},

   title = {Load probability density forecasting by transforming and combining quantile forecasts},
   journal = {Applied Energy},
   volume = {277},
   abstract = {Compared with traditional deterministic load forecasting, probabilistic load forecasting (PLF) help us understand the potential risks in the power system operation by providing more information about future uncertainties of the loads. Quantile forecasting, as a kind of non-parametric probabilistic forecasting method, has been well developed and widely used in PLF. However, the results of quantile forecasts are discrete, which contain fewer details than density forecasts which provide the most comprehensive information. This paper proposes a novel day-ahead load probability density forecasting method by transforming and combining multiple quantile forecasts. The proposed method includes two main steps: transformation and combination. In the first step, the kernel density estimation method is used to transform the individual quantile forecast into the probability density curve; in the second step, an optimization problem is established to obtain the weighted combination of different probability density forecasts. The perturbation search method is applied to determine the optimal weight of each individual forecast. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method using comprehensive case studies on the real-world load data from Guangdong province in China, ISO New England (ISO-NE) in the US and Irish smart meter data. Case studies show that the combined model is robust to kernel function selection in the transformation step and has better forecasting performance. Compared with the best individual model, the purposed combined model has an accuracy improvement of 1.54% in the Guangdong dataset and 2.9% in the ISO-NE dataset in terms of the continuous ranked probability score. The proposed combination forecasting method can be robust in high volatility scenarios.},

   pages = {7202},
   abstract = {With the target of carbon neutrality in 2060, China’s energy system must undergo a huge transformation. Based on the bottom-up energy system model China-TIMES, this paper generates energy consumption, CO2 emissions and technology options for the future deep decarbonization scenario. The model result shows that the peak time of CO2 will significantly affect the emission level in 2050 and will have a crucial impact on the achievement of carbon neutrality. Quantitative analysis indicates electric vehicles and renewable energy will be essential if we hope to accomplish carbon neutrality target. With the rapid development of electric vehicles, the demand for energy storage technology is growing, and the operating mode of energy storage technology will change from charging at night to charging during the day. The coordinated development of electric vehicles, renewable energy and energy storage technology will become a highlight of China's low carbon transition.},
