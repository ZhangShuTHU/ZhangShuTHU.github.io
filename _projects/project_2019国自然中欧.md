This project proposes to investigate the urban energy transformation in an integrated Socio-Techno-Economic framework that covers multiple stakeholders (governing body, enterprises and citizens), multiple sectors (electricity, gas, transport and heating/cooling), multiple spatial levels (national, city and community) and multiple time-scales (long-term planning, short-term operation and real-time control). The project "STEP-UP" will utilise and share between the research partners the wealth of data and knowledge already gathered in previous and on-going projects as a foundation on operation, use, carbon reduction potential and best business practice for sustainable urban energy systems. The overall aim is to provide an integrated planning and deployment strategy for multipurpose urban energy system and its enabling infrastructure in EU and Chinese cities, which is supported by these objectives:

1. To develop simulation tools for testing low-carbon urban energy market regulations by using agent-based market simulation methodology and probabilistic models for behaviour of actors.

2. To demonstrate business models emerging from intelligent urban energy system as well as the exploitation of demand flexibility, making use of in depth case study analysis of specific services.

3. To develop data-driven short and long-term demand forecasting models, that integrate multi-spatial, multi-temporal and multi-sector.

4. To develop decentralized control algorithms that balance the efficiency of decisions and risk of cyber-attacks.

5. To create an integrated strategic planning evaluation framework to assess environmental, level of service and economical performance of urban energy system from a multi-stakeholder perspective.

6. To identify the sources of risk and uncertainty affecting transitions to sustainable urban energy system operations for the multiple stakeholders involved and investigate robust and stochastic optimisation techniques to address the challenges of infrastructure planning.

7. To understand the role of various storage technologies in efficient and resilient operation and planning of urban energy system.8. To provide roadmaps for EU and Chinese metropolitan areas for gradually up-scaling sustainable energy system in an efficient way.
