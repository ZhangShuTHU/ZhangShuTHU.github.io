The Green China Research Flagship is a joint research collaboration between the DRC, Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China (MOF), and the World Bank Group. The Program aims to provide research and analysis on current patterns of economic development and their environmental consequences and identify policy options to accelerate China’s transition to a sustainable, carbon-neutral and more resource-efficient economy. In addition to generating knowledge, the program provides a platform for cross-sectoral policy dialogue and engagement between DRC, the World Bank, and other government counterparts.
