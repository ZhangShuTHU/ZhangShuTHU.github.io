I completed my undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University with a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering (supervised by Prof. <a href='https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/cqkang.htm'>Chongqing Kang</a>) and a B. Econ. in Economics. I earned my Ph.D. in Management (supervised by Prof. <a href='http://www.3e.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/article/158'>Wenying Chen</a>) at Tsinghua University. From March 2022 to April 2023, I served as a visiting research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (supervised by Prof. <a href='https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/volker-krey'>Volker Krey).

I have published several research papers in academic journals such as Nature Sustainability, Nature Communications, and Engineering. 

My research interests include energy system modeling, water-energy-food nexus as well as energy and climate policy analysis.
